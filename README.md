# Liquidity Pool Smart Contract
This project provides a simple Liquidity Pool contract written in Solidity, enabling the creation of liquidity pools and the issuance of Liquidity Pool Tokens (LST) when liquidity is provided. The contract supports:

### Adding Liquidity: Users can provide liquidity and receive LST tokens in return.
### Removing Liquidity: Users can redeem LST tokens to remove their liquidity.
### Current Liquidity Tracking: View the current liquidity of the contract.
Additionally, a frontend interface is provided for seamless interaction with the smart contract.

## Getting Started
### Get Token Addresses
Identify or deploy the addresses for Token A and Token B to use in the liquidity pool.

## Deploy LST Token
Deploy the Liquidity Pool Token (LST) and note its contract address.

## Replace Contract Addresses
Update the script script/DeployLiquidityPool.s.sol with the correct addresses for Token A, Token B, and the LST token.

## Deployed Contract Addresses (Example)
For reference, here are the deployed contract addresses for this project:

### Token A Address: 0xb86Eaa036a19F55744aB15c47f05B72Db5e52428
### Token B Address: 0x13dec0A47f9b910A8C186b342017d1e1Bc37f5C6
### LST Token Address: 0x8A2e3a63D6dc8430a5FBAC8a48865C4c61C22395
